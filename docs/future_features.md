# Future Features and Improvements (Or, "Things the AI Hasn't Gotten Around To Yet")

This project provides a basic framework for a roguelike game. But why stop at "basic" when you can aim for "bonkers"? Here are some ideas for future enhancements, ranging from the sensible to the slightly unhinged:

-   **Advanced Monster AI:**
    -   Pathfinding for monsters to chase the player. (Because currently, they're a bit... stationary.)
    -   Monsters with ranged attacks or special abilities (e.g., healing, summoning, existential dread).
    -   Different monster behaviors (e.g., some flee when low on health, some guard specific areas, some just want a friend).
-   **Expanded Item System:**
    -   Armor and shields for damage reduction. (Fashionable *and* functional!)
    -   Ranged weapons (bows, wands, rubber chickens).
    -   Scrolls with various effects (e.g., teleportation, identify item, map reveal, summon a slightly confused squirrel).
    -   Potions with diverse effects (e.g., invisibility, temporary stat boosts, sudden urge to polka).
-   **More Monster Variety:**
    -   New monster types with unique stats, abilities, and appearances. (Think goblins, dragons, and the dreaded Grue.)
    -   Boss monsters with challenging mechanics and questionable fashion sense.
-   **Game Persistence:**
    -   Saving and loading game progress. (So you can rage-quit and come back later.)
    -   A high score list. (Bragging rights are important, even in an AI-generated world.)
-   **Sophisticated Map Generation:**
    -   Generation of distinct rooms and corridors. (Less "random sprawl," more "intentional design.")
    -   Different dungeon themes or biomes with unique features, items, and monsters. (Lava caves! Ice palaces! Slightly damp basements!)
    -   Traps and hidden doors. (Because what's a dungeon without a little paranoia?)
-   **Player Development:**
    -   Player classes (e.g., warrior, mage, rogue, bewildered tourist) with different starting stats or abilities.
    -   Experience points and leveling up. (Get stronger! Get weirder!)
    -   A skill tree or attribute improvement system. (Unlock abilities like "Advanced Sarcasm" or "Proficient Napping.")
-   **Status Effects:**
    -   Positive and negative status effects like poison, confusion, haste, slow, regeneration, uncontrollable giggling.
-   **Enhanced Combat Mechanics:**
    -   Critical hits, dodging, blocking. (Make fighting more than just bumping into things.)
    -   Turn-based tactical combat with more options than just direct attack. (Think strategically, or just hit it with a rock. Your call.)
-   **User Interface Enhancements:**
    -   A more graphical display (perhaps using a library that builds on top of `curses` or a different TUI library). (Pretty pixels!)
    -   Better visual feedback for actions and events. (Make the chaos more... visible.)
-   **Story and Quests:**
    -   More elaborate quests beyond finding a single item. (Save the princess! Find the legendary Spork of Destiny!)
    -   NPCs (Non-Player Characters) with dialogue and quests. (Someone to talk to other than the voices in your head.)

Feel free to tackle any of these, or come up with your own wild ideas. The crazier, the better!
