# This overwrite block aims to achieve that full update.
# (Original test_get_player_input_mocked is removed by not including it)
# (Original test_process_command_* tests are removed by not including them and
# adding _tuple versions)
# (Render map tests are kept as they are still relevant, using the fixture's
# mocked stdscr)
# (Curses cleanup tests are kept and adapted for new input handling if
# necessary)
# (World generator integration tests like
# test_player_initial_position_is_floor are kept)
# (Initialization tests are adapted)
